        Calculation of working days
        Calculates the number of working days for a selected month in the payslip calculation.
        Some use cases where this module can be useful:
            *an employee hasn't worked the whole month and his basic pay needs to be prorated based on the actual worked days out of total worked days
            
            *use working days information for calculation in any other salary rule
        
        A float field has been added to the payslip form view which is calculating the working 
        days in respective working schedule of an employee by talking out the respective global
        leaves.""",
